![Arduino &amp; Fritzing Sketches](https://raw.github.com/manifestinteractive/arduino/master/assets/logo.png "Arduino &amp; Fritzing Sketches")
Introduction
-------
This is my playground for making Arduino projects.  Once I get them working the way I want, I fire up Fritzing and generate a wiring diagram for the project so I can remember how to do it next time.

So to play with this stuff too, you will need to make sure you have the following applications installed:

* Download Arduino: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

* Download Fritzing: http://fritzing.org/download/

Assets Folder
-------
This just has the logo, not really anything important, but needed a place to put it ;)


Fritzing Folder
-------
This folder contains a folder for custom Parts that are not available in the Fritzing application that I have either created, or downloaded from the internet.


Libraries Folder
-------
This will contain Arduino library code that you will need to have installed for projects that #include any libraries.


Projects Folder
-------
Each Arduino project also has it's own *Fritzing* folder that contains a .fzz file.  I have already rendered out the breadboard & schematic images.  You an also find an HTML file in the root of each project containing the Bill of Materials which lists the items you will need for that project.
